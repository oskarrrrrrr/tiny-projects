# Butter [WIP]


A simple spreadsheet program.


It's more similar to Numbers on MacOS than, for example, to Excel, because it
allows the user to have multiple tables on one sheet instead of a single, large
collection of cells.

What works for now:
- adding tables, moving them around and scrolling the view
- dynamically resizing the app
- should work on HiDPI and regular displays alike

The general goal is allow the user to write and execute simple formulas.

To run: `go run .` To exit press q.
