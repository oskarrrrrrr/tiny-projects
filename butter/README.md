# Butter [WIP]


A simple spreadsheet program.


It's more similar to Numbers on MacOS than, for example, to Excel, because it
allows the user to have multiple tables on one sheet instead of a single, large
collection of cells.

What works for now:
- adding tables, moving them around and scrolling the view
- highlighting table cells and displaying arbitrary text inside
- dynamically resizing the app
- should work on HiDPI and regular displays alike

Loose goals:
- allow the user to write and execute simple formulas
- make a simple graphical interface that's easy to use

To run: `go run .` To exit press q.
