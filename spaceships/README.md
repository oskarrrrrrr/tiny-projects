# Spaceships


A simple spaceships game.

Inspired by this [tutorial](https://www.parallelrealities.co.uk/tutorials/#shooter).
However, almost nothing has been copied directly.

The font is borrowed from [here](https://opengameart.org/content/bitmap-font-maker).\
The sounds are taken from [here](https://opengameart.org/content/space-shooter-sound-effects).\
The textures were handmade in GIMP.\


## Running the game

The game should work on Linux and MacOS.

1. Make sure you have SDL2, SDL2 Image and SDL2 Mixer installed.
